Remote video surveillance based on: JavaCV, JavaFX, Symfony.

It's a remote video surveillance system which includes 3 applications: video server (JavaCV, JavaFX), internet server (PHP, Symfony2.3) and client (JavaCV, JavaFX). The purpose of this project is access to a remote video-archive. It's not a remote streaming or cloud. Client downloads videos and photos from remote video-server through internet server.
Some interesting parts of code in this project that could be useful for someone: https://github.com/d-a-gerashenko/com.videoweber/tree/master/server/src/com/videoweber/lib/engines/javacv

Project is not finished. There are some stability and performance issues.

It's not maven I'm sorry for that.
