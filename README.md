Remote video surveillance based on: JavaCV, JavaFX, Symfony.

It's a remote video surveillance system which includes 3 applications: video server (JavaCV, JavaFX), internet server (PHP, Symfony2.3) and client (JavaCV, JavaFX). The purpose of this project is access to a remote video-archive. It's not a remote streaming or cloud. Client downloads videos and photos from remote video-server through internet server. Project works unstable and to solve this problem it needs to change fundamental decisions. Now I have no more time for this so I decided to open it. At least there are some interesting parts of code in this project that could be useful for someone.

It's not maven I'm sorry for that. I should change it but have no time yet.
